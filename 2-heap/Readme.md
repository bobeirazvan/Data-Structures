#Heap 

In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property: in a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C.The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.

In the source code I implemented a max-heap class . It can be turned into a min-heap if you swap some signs . The program read from a file some operations . There are 2 types operations : 1 && 2. If operation is of type 1 the program add value to the heap ELSE it display the root(maximum value) && remove the root.
